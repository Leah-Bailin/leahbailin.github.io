  <p class="head">Summary</p>
  <ul>I am organized, persistent, growth-focused, creative, and a good communicator. I aim to broaden my experience outside the field of science. I have learned many important technical practices through my years in the University of Iowa's undergraduate biology program. I wish to use these skills and knowledge to bridge the gap between science and industry.  I enjoy working on challenging projects that encourage originality in a fast-paced setting while striving to learn more about the changing field I am in.
